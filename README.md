# 🧬 Mitosis Simulation

This project is a **Mitosis Simulation** built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
It visually demonstrates how a single cell divides and multiplies, inspired by the process of **mitosis** in biology.

## 🚀 Features
- Cell movement and random interactions.
- Cell growth and division into daughter cells.
- Real-time animation using **Pygame**.
- Adjustable parameters (speed, size, division rate, etc.).
